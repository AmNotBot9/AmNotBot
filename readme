Project Title: Job Listing Parser with Export (Remote Python Jobs)

Description:

This Python script fetches job listings from the "Remote Python Jobs" website (https://www.remotepython.com/jobs/) and extracts relevant information like title, URL, experience level (based on keywords), job type (remote/on-site), and a snippet of the job description. The extracted data is then exported to user-specified locations in CSV, Excel, and JSON formats for easy analysis and further processing.

Installation:

Clone this repository.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

Install the required Python libraries using pip:

Bash
pip install httpx parsel pandas
Use code with caution.

Usage:

Edit the save_path variable in the script (# Set the save location for CSV, Excel, and JSON) to your desired location for the exported files (e.g., /path/to/your/documents).

Run the script:

Bash
python job_listing_parser.py
Use code with caution.

Output:

The script will export the parsed job listings to three files in the specified save_path:

cybersecurity_jobs.csv: CSV file containing the job data.
cybersecurity_jobs.xlsx: Excel file containing the job data.
cybersecurity_jobs.json: JSON file containing the job data in a structured format.
Note:

This script currently targets "Remote Python Jobs". You can easily modify it to work with other websites by adjusting the URL and parsing logic based on their HTML structure.

Libraries:

httpx: A powerful HTTP client for making asynchronous requests.
parsel: A CSS selector library for efficiently parsing HTML content.
pandas: A popular Python library for data manipulation and analysis (used for creating DataFrames and exporting to CSV/Excel).
json: Built-in Python library for working with JSON data.
Feel free to:

Add more job details if available on the website (e.g., company name, salary range, etc.).
Implement error handling to gracefully handle network issues or unexpected HTML structures.
Refine the keyword-based logic for identifying experience level and job type.
Expand the script to work with multiple job listing websites.
Explore advanced parsing techniques using regular expressions or other libraries.
